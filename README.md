# Hospital Failure Cascade Digital Twin

## MVP Question
**If Hospital A suddenly loses 20% of its nursing staff, which departments fail next, in what order, and why—over a 72-hour period?**

## Project Scope
This project builds a causal digital twin of a hospital to simulate failure cascades under capacity stress.
It focuses on explaining how failures propagate, not on prediction or optimization.

## Status
Phase 1 complete.
Phase 2 in progress.
